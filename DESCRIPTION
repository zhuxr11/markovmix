Description: Fit mixture of Markov chains of higher orders from multiple
    sequences. It is also compatible with ordinary 1-component, 1-order or
    single-sequence Markov chains. Various utility functions are provided
    to derive transition patterns, transition probabilities per component
    and component priors. In addition, print(), predict() and component
    extracting/replacing methods are also defined as a convention of
    mixture models.
